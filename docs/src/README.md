# NVIM Flake

An Nvim flake tailored for my requirements. This takes an amalgamation of some popular Nvim flake implementations and applys my opinion to it.

## Opinions

- [Leader Key] - I generally prefer leader key triggered actions and like them to be shown via whichKey
- [Presence] - I have no interest in broadcasting what I am working on to Discord
- [Project] - I already have a good porject workflow so do not need it in vim.
- [Session] - I use Tmux for sticky sessions so I don't need a session manager.
